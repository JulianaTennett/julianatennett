            <h3>THE FIGURES</h3>
              <p>Embrace Yourself relies on figures, rather than words, to express its message. This allows the beauty of each hand drawn figure to speak for itself. The style of the drawings is very simple, elegant, and artistic, elevating these body types into realms of beauty and high art that they are not normally seen in. The campaign only uses black and white to maintain the elegance of the artwork and let the figures speak for themselves without distraction or embellishment.
              <br>
              <br>
              Each poster in the Embrace Yourself series shows a single figure on a white page, with no other text, again driving home the point that each of these figures is a piece of art. The campaign relies on these posters being displayed in public areas in mass quantities to enhance the idea that there are so many different types of bodies than the ones we are being shown in the media. </p>

              <h3>CONCEPTUALIZING AN APP</h3>
                <p>The mobile app is an integral part of the Embrace Yourself campaign because it brings viewers into the campaign itself. Users of the app  are able to upload a picture of their own bodies to be translated by the app into drawn figures. They have the option to save the drawing for themselves or upload it to the app’s universal gallery. This app acts as an ever-growing digital series of artworks based on real women touched by the Embrace Yourself Campaign. It is an extension of the campaign itself that has the ability to grow long after the campaign has ended.</p>

                <p>Embrace Yourself is a body positivity campaign I designed for Graphic Design 2. The purpose of the campaign is to encourage women to recognize their diverse body types as beautiful. The campaign was developed in response to a lack of representation of body types in the media, and therefore focuses on representing these body types in large quantities and in as many environments as possible. The campaign is made up of a series of posters, figures painted onto fitting room doors, and a mobile app.
