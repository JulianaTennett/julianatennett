            <h3>CONCEPTUALIZATIONS</h3>
            <p>My initial instinct for this project was to create an interactive sex ed information graphic, but quickly decided against this in order to pursue a more abstracted concept. There’s so much to talk about when it comes to sex ed, but I needed to narrow down my focus, so I started thinking about the general things I wanted to cover and realized my criticisms often had to do with a lack of diversity taught in their curriculum. They tend to zone in on one path of sexuality, one “Big Truth”, while leaving out the many more paths that exist in people’s sexual lives. I decided to visualize the disparities between sex ed and reality by illustrating the One Big Truth, and then minimizing that truth and populating the area around it with many other diverse truths. </p>

              <p>On these screens, the comparison is being made of the heterosexual-heavy curriculum surrounding sex education compared to the very diverse range of sexualities and orientations that exist in the real world. It’s important to educate teenagers on the existence of these orientations, as well as the nuances that come into play during sexual activity in each one.</p>

                <p>I could talk for hours about how we could and should improve our sexual education programs across America, so when given the opportunity to create a passion project for my Programming Basics final, I knew what topic I wanted to focus on. I decided to combine my illustration and Processing to create an interactive experience that demonstrates visually how sexual education differs from reality. </p>
