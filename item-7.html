            <h3>THE PROCESS</h3>
            <p>The process for this project started with my meeting with the Artistic Director of the concert. In this meeting, we discussed the purpose of the campaign, the different elements that needed to be created, and what the client was looking for in terms of look and feel. The words "celebration", "fireworks", and "birthdays" were thrown around, and with this art direction, I took to designing the first part of the campaign: the save the date information card.</p>

            <h3>
            </h3>
            <p>Traditionally, the materials for this concert have been based on photography and headshots of the composers featured, which left the series feeling very formal and rigid. I decided to leave out the photography for a more graphically-driven approach that could achieve the fiery, celebratory feeling the client was looking for. My mind went right to sparklers; visually, they are super interesting and their symbol definitely represents excitement. I also wanted to incorporate the ‘birthday’ concept my client had mentioned, so I combined the sparklers with a suggested shape of a cake.</p>

                <p>While interning at the New England Conservatory, I had the opportunity to create a design campaign for the conservatory's 26th Annual Composer Anniversary Series. This project was particularly special to me because it was the first full campaign I was given total creative freedom on from start to finish. The campaign has four parts: a save the date card to be passed out at other NEC concerts, an invitation to be mailed to a pre-existing guest list, an emailable version of the invitation to be sent to NEC's mailing list, and a large format sign to be presented outside of NEC's concert hall.</p>
